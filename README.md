# alica-plan-designer-fx

The alica-plan-designer-fx is the new version of the alica plan designer, which is still in development.

# Installation Guide
For the development of this project IntelliJ is used. You can download it from https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/ .
In IntelliJ you open the root folder of the repo and are ready to go (expecting that IDEA is recognizing the .idea folder as existing project). If you want to start a debug build you can right click on the PlanDesigner class and choose Run or Debug.

For other IDEs you can import the pom.xml to import the project.
